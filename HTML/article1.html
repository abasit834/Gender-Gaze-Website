        <p>The haunting echo of 'Boys don't cry' serves as a reminder of society's cruel decree that denies emotional expression to boys, suffocating sensitivity within masculinity. In a world where emotional expression is restricted, it is essential to explore the mental health divide between genders in Pakistan and work towards creating a society that embraces the emotional well-being of all. This piece not only probes into Pakistan's mental health disparities but also draws from insightful one-on-one interviews with field experts, offering valuable perspectives.</p>
        <p>20 million Pakistanis, 10% of the population. This is the approximate number of people affected by mental disorders in Pakistan. Aligning with global trends, women in Pakistan bear a disproportionate burden, experiencing higher rates of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. A study carried out in the villages of Chitral revealed that the prevalence of anxiety and depression amongst women was 46% in comparison to males who had a 15% prevalence. Other studies have shown Pakistani women to be at a higher risk of suicide.</p>
        <p>What drives the tides of mental well-being? Genes play a significant role in shaping these differences, influencing thoughts, emotions, and behaviour. Certain genes may make women more susceptible to feeling down compared to males. In men, feelings of isolation or melancholy may be linked to specific proteins associated with inflammation. Additionally, hormones and genes related to brain development can also impact mental health in different ways depending on gender and specific circumstances.</p>
        
        <p>While biology certainly wields influence over the mental health disparity between genders, let us not overlook the shadow cast by other factors. Domestic violence, the pressure to conform to societal ideals of beauty and behaviour, discrimination, and the cruel hand of injustice all conspire as silent architects of suffering. Evidence has suggested that genes and genetic interplay with the environment both contribute to the risk of depression. When mental health experts were asked to weigh in they reported:</p>
        <p><em>Societal issues involve generalised, age-old stigmas that are further reinforced by our cultural archetypes, all of which lead to extreme or unrealistic expectations from each gender to be upheld</em></p>
        
        
        <p>The primary source of pain for most women was found to be conflicts within their partnerships. A four-year survey carried out at a psychiatric clinic in Karachi revealed 70% of the women seeking help had been a victim of gender-based violence (domestic violence, sexual harassment and rape). A study conducted by the United Nations suggests that around 50% of women fall victim to physical violence, while another study paints an even graver picture, estimating this number to soar to 80% potentially.</p>
        
        <p>The ingrained patriarchal belief in male superiority and the archaic notion of male honour not only provide rationalisations for gender-based violence but also strip away the humanity of men. The mantra, 'boys don't cry,' instils the belief that suppressing emotions is a sign of strength or masculinity, which can be damaging by invalidating the emotional experiences of males. This ideology breeds simmering resentment and frustration, finding release in violent expressions toward the gender perceived as 'weak'. Tragically, it also acts as a barrier, preventing men from seeking support when needed. It has been observed that men pose a greater hesitancy in seeking psychiatric help compared to women.  When mental health experts were asked about their male clients they reported:</p>
        <p><em>Most of them are expected to employ their own defence mechanisms and try to cope with their stressors rather than sit and talk about their emotions and face them</em></p>
        
        <p>The disparities extend even to those seeking help. When asked about the disparities women face when seeking help the experts pointed out the lack of rehabilitation facilities for females and a lack of trained staff including nurses to work closely with female patients:</p>
        
        <p><em>We have very few rehab centres where trained staff is working, making it impossible to cater to the needs of female clients so female clients are neglected in that sense</em></p>

        <p> Women often bear the burden of being labelled as overly sensitive or 'too serious,' while men frequently face stereotypes of being aggressive and demanding. These societal impressions, drawn from everyday experiences, unfortunately, seep into the diagnoses given by healthcare practitioners. Our expert who was interviewed reported:</p>
        
        <p><em>… stereotypes of women being moody so they must have a mood disorder and men being angry, I’m not saying that these stereotypes are coming from a place of fantasy, but when diagnosing a patient we need to have a clear and neutral mind, we have tests and assessments that we can rely on instead of diagnosing based on stereotypes</em></p>
        
        <p>Consensus among mental health experts confirmed the fundamental role of communities in addressing the mental health gap. They unanimously stressed the significance of promoting open dialogues at a basic level and breaking down stigmas surrounding mental health to establish safe spaces for individuals to express their emotions without compromising their self-worth. In response to inquiries about potential policies and legislations to address mental health disparities in Pakistan, their proposed solutions included:</p>
        
        <p><em>Introducing legislation that caters to mental health cases, within various contexts like imprisonment, employment, societally, and at home</em></p>
        
        <p><em>Employee rights should involve being able to have mental health leaves or breaks, and organisations should be made compulsory to integrate psychological counselling or therapy as part of their services provided to employees at every company</em></p>
