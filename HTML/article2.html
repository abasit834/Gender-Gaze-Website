        <p>‘It’s harder for men, but we have to adjust for the sake of our responsibilities.' "You haven’t seen the worst of the world yet.” These statements were said to me, along with many other unpleasant words about the dynamic of privilege I have as a woman. I have been on the receiving end of wage gaps, degrading curse words, and absolute exploitation. Still, I have seen nothing, according to men. </p>
        
        <p>Ever since I started pursuing a career in our rocky yet somewhat-established corporate industry, I haven’t been the same. The double standards and hypocrisy are so astonishingly intense that raising your voice is considered an act of ‘sensitivity.’ However, as a 26-year-old woman, I can finally realize the potential of my voice and how it can be a catalyst for some much-needed change. Even if it makes me ‘sensitive.’ So, let’s discuss something I wish we could be more honest about: Workplace Inequality. So, if you were a woman and felt like your male colleagues with the same experience were being given more credit than you in monetary and other terms, there is a name for that. </p>
        
        
        <p>Wage gaps, harassment, behavioral issues, and more examples can be used to better explain this term. Even housewives are not exempt from constantly being devalued for their domestic contributions because ‘it’s not as tough as what a man does outside the house.’ Sounds bonkers right? Something out of a fictional concept. Well, it’s very much real and is heavily impacting women in different organizations and work cultures. </p>
        

        <strong>‘Our Company Believes in Empowering Women’ </strong>
        
        <p>In 2023, almost every successful company is channeling its supposedly feminist persona. Words of encouragement, supportive posts, and a positive front. But what goes behind the scenes is mostly unknown. There are a plethora of issues women face in workplaces. And if you are a woman occupying a leadership role, may God help you. After decades of reserved spaces and limited roles, women are still navigating their way through different fields. The majority of which are still filled by men. Even labels and qualities have a nature well-suited for men than their counterparts. For instance, if I am driven and question everything with logic, I will be called ‘too rigid.’ But if a man does the same, he is titled a ‘leader.’ Similarly, women's labor is far more criticized in terms of input than men's; a male cook is a ‘chef’ whereas a woman in the same role is just embracing her natural responsibilities. </p>
        <p>In such a man-dominated world, when a company calls itself ‘women-friendly,’ its policies and structures suggest otherwise. Adopting something for the sake of acceptance and wholeheartedly integrating it are two different concepts. The difference is still indistinguishable for our corporate systems. And if a poor soul does end up raising their concerns, a twisted form of address that highlights their gender limitations is delivered, even unabashedly so. This not only leads to internalized shame and struggle but also demoralizes women and their internal beliefs. </p>

        
        <p>If you aim to apply anywhere or get shortlisted for an interview, ask the questions that matter. Inquire about the codes and rules that are at play and observe the employed women there to know what you can expect. </p>
        <strong>‘But It Used to be Worse!’</strong>

        <p>The good old ‘Our times were worse and we struggled more,’ is not an excuse. If a colleague in her 50s talks about how fortunate you are to have feminism and equality, this doesn’t mean you stop striving for a better future. We get that it used to be worse, but the idea is to evolve and grow continuously. We have a responsibility to call out unfair treatment and ensure a collaborative environment where women get well-suited opportunities that are not designed to serve only men. </p>
        <p>In a patriarchal society where we see hundreds of honor-killing news and professional women being subjected to awful things, we are bound by a set of rules. Rules that are deeply associated with women serving the present system. Similarly, our workspaces represent ideals and policies that benefit one gender more than the other. How many companies in Pakistan provide menstrual leaves or organize drives that majorly impact women? Very few. Which can be an optimist’s ‘but hey, at least it’s happening,’ but a realist’s ‘not in my company or work circle.’ You would think that the least we can get are menstrual products but they cost a lot, specifically; patriarchal dignity. 
        </p>

        <p>The goal here is not to promote equality but rather equity which dedicates a set of favors and perks for women based on the struggles they face. Having detailed sessions, collecting regular feedback, and instilling self-esteem and awareness are just some of the things we can do to have a vocal, connected, and truly happy workforce. 

        </p>

        <strong>‘Women Support Women’ </strong>

        <p>Barbie was the hottest release of 2023 for how it presented the age-old concepts of feminism, toxic masculinity, and the unrealistic standards women face wherever they go. Pitting us against each other is what patriarchy does best and we have been too brainwashed to think that it’s a faulty system and not the catty nature of the female gender that instigates, provokes, and harms an entire gender. </p>
        
        <p>This happens a lot more than we would like. But oftentimes an expressive woman is silenced in a workplace, it’s through another woman. The more we are exposed to an insensitive culture, the more desensitized we are prone to become. To the extent that an outsider with an unbiased vision may feel like a threat. We, as a culture, fear expressive, confident, and assertive women. Unfortunately, all of these qualities belong to a healthy work atmosphere. </p>
        <p>The biggest issue at hand isn’t the manipulation or attitude checks we get from the management, but rather the ones we get from fellow women. Colleagues in a workspace can react to the environment differently. One set of morals doesn’t have to represent everyone but there is a line we must draw. When it comes to emotional violation, toxic positivity, and raw frustration. We need to be compassionate towards each other. It doesn’t mean we remove accountability but rather help each other explore daily issues and queries in a united and humane manner. Instead of the ‘to each their own’ mindset, it’s time we move in a collective and community-oriented way. Honest discussions and sound solutions should be delivered without judgment and sourness. </p>
        <p>We must understand that the allyship we expect from the surroundings and men has to first come from the unity between women. Instead of cutting each other down, creating an empathetic front will empower us and help us grow as professionals with dignity and dedication. </p>
